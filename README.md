## What's this do?
- It makes sequence charts (in svg, png or jpeg) from your MscGen scripts. From the command line.
- It also does so for your X첫 and MsGenny scripts.
- There's a boatload of other things it can do - see below.

### Cool. How do I install it?
```sh
   npm install --global sverweij/mscgenjs-cli
```

### How do I use this?
```sh
   mscgenjs coolchart.mscgen
```
This will generate `coolchart.svg`:

![the result from above command. It's a png, but that's because we can't embed svg's in github (yet, probably)](samples/coolchart.png)

### But I want png's!
```sh
   mscgenjs -T png coolchart.mscgen
```

### But ...
- But isn't it more practical to have an **interactive interpreter** for this?   
  When you **edit** sequence charts: definitely!
  - Scoot over to [mscgen_js][mscgen_js] for an on line interpreter.
  - If you're using [atom][atom] you'll :heart: the
    [mscgen-preview][mscgen-preview] package.
- But there's also the **original** `mscgen`. Why should I use this instead?    
  - Yes there is. It's a lot faster too. And it's the original.
  - The graphics look different though.
  - And it does not understand X첫 or MsGenny - so if you'd want
    to use things like `alt` or `loop` in your charts you'd have to
    use _tricks_.

### More options?

Yes. Run `mscgenjs` with `-h` or `--help` as option to get all its options:

```
  Usage: mscgen [options] [infile]

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number
    -T --output-type <type>  one of svg|png|jpeg|mscgen|msgenny|xu|dot|doxygen
    -I --input-type <type>   one of mscgen|xu|msgenny|ast
    -i --input-from <file>   File to read from. use - for stdin.
    -o --output-to <file>    File to write to. use - for stdout.
    -p --parser-output       Print parsed msc output
    -l --license             Display license and exit
```

Writing to stdout works currently only works for non-graphical output formats
(mscgen, msgenny, xu, dot, doxygen).

### Basic use: produce pictures from a script
This will generate a sequence chart called `intro02_starter.svg` in the
same directory as the `intro02_start.mscgen` script
```sh
    mscgenjs intro02_starter.mscgen
```

If you want to have the output go somewhere else, specify it:
```sh
   mscgenjs -o othername.svg intro02_starter.mscgen
```

`mscgenjs` will try to guess the type of script from the extension. Here
it will guess the input to be X첫. If it doesn't know, it'll assume it got
MscGen passed.
```sh
    mscgenjs test51_with_alt.xu
```

If you want to override the guessing use -I, so to force the input to be
parsed as MscGen:
```sh
    mscgenjs -I mscgen test51_with_alt.xu
```


### Conversion
With `-T` (or `--output-type` you can specify the type of output.
By default `mscgen.js` assumes _svg_. Some other formats:

To convert an X첫 or MsGenny script with advanced options back to
vanilla MscGen (without advanced options):
```sh
    mscgenjs  -T mscgen -i funky.xu funky.mscgen
```

To convert an MscGen script to _graphviz dot_:
```sh
    mscgenjs -T dot -i intro02_starter.mscgen intro02_starter.dot
```

To convert to raster graphics
```sh
    mscgenjs -T png -i dolores.mscgen -o dolores.png
```

You can also send specify standard output as a destination, so you can
pipe the output to something else. E.g. to graphviz dot to further process
a dot program:
```sh
    mscgenjs -T dot -i intro02_starter.mscgen -o - | dot -Tsvg > communicationsdiagram.svg
```

### Parser output and input
To show how the parser interpreted your input into an abstract syntax tree use
the `-p` option
```sh
    mscgenjs -p -o parsed.json intro02_starter.mscgen
```

You can in turn render the abstract syntax tree by specifying it as input
type:
```sh
    mscgenjs parsed.json
```
